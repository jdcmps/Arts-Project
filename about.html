                            In previous years, the Philippine railway system served as the country’s main mode of transportation. 
                            It was the first avenue of transportation that created more mobility in the Northern and Central parts of 
                            Luzon, ultimately aiding in the region’s economic growth. However, the railway systems were left significantly 
                            damaged after World War II, and the slow reconstruction of the railway systems led to an increased demand for 
                            public road transportation. As a result, numerous modes of public land transportation emerged, including the 
                            Jeepneys in the early 1950s.

                        <p class="about-info">
                            Jeepneys originated from the military vehicles that the United States left behind in the country after World 
                            War II. The surplus of military Willys General Purpose (GP) vehicles and trucks left behind by the Americans 
                            was used to address the demand for public transportation. The jeeps were converted and repurposed into public 
                            transportation vehicles, giving birth to the jeepneys as we know them today. The word jeepney originated from 
                            the words “jitney”, a then-popular American term for a taxicab, and “jeep”, from the military abbreviation of 
                            “GP” meaning General Purpose (vehicle).

                        <p class="about-info">
                            The earliest jeepneys called the auto calesas (AC) were only able to accommodate 6-8 passengers and were able 
                            to travel freely on any route. They were soon outphased by the Public Utility Jeepneys that we see today. These 
                            jeepneys can house almost up to 20 passengers, but unlike the previous ACs, PUJs only travel on chosen fixed 
                            routes.

                            Since the 1950s, jeepney models have been heavily mass-produced, most notably by Sarao motors, eventually 
                            turning the jeepney into the most common mode of public transportation in the country. They’ve even been 
                            dubbed as the kings of the road because of their large frames and aggressive road presence. Now, jeepneys 
                            have immersed themselves to be a significant part of Filipino culture. Aside from the convenience that jeepneys 
                            bring to the everyday Filipino, jeepneys have also been appreciated for their aesthetic side because of their 
                            visible jeepney art.
